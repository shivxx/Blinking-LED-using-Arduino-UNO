# Blinking-LED-using-Arduino-UNO
Blinking LED is one of the important projects in alerting someone to indicate the presence of object. But in normal circuit it is difficult to adjust time of turning on and turning of time. Which ultimately lower the chances visibility.But with the help of arduino we can control the timing of light on and off according to our need.
This project demonstrates how we have implemented blinking LED using Arduino. Pin modes configuration is used to indicate the pin of the arduino which we are using. We can set whatever time of on and off of the LED as per the requirement and with that single pin of the arduino we can connect as much LED as we want.
